# CS 101 Resources

This is a collection of lab problems that were given to me when I took the CS 101 (Computer Programming and Utilization) course, along with my solutions to them.
It also contains the Project I wrote for this course.

Hopefully, this will prove useful to you!

Some books and resources I found useful during my CS 101 were "An Introduction to Programming through C++" by Professor Abhiram Ranade,
and the video lectures by him that are given during your course (the full playlist can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzRYVm0a65eklyMDXGSWObRA-7lCdkSm)). I also recommend [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) to get a more in depth knowledge about the C++ Programming Language.
